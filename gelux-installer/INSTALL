Building gelux-installer
---------------------



REQUIREMENTS:

- A JDK for Linux such as the IBM Jikes compiler or the Sun/Blackdown compiler.
  Make sure that javadoc, javac, java etc. is in your PATH.
  Warning: JNI calls are not compatible with Metrowerks JIT compiler on
  JDK PowerPC 1.1.  Be sure to unset the JAVA_COMPILER variable.

- GTK2 and/or GNOME2 libraries.
  If you install these from rpm, you should get both the system rpm and the 
  developer rpm (the latter containing the files for pkg-config and headerfiles).
  Your rpm distributer may chose not to split the packages in this way.

- GCJ release 3.0.0 or higher. See http://gcc.gnu.org/java/


CONFIGURE THE BUILDPROCESS:

Run ./configure using the following flags to customize the build:

--libdir=<install dir for shared objects>
eg. --libdir=/usr/lib

--with-gcj-prefix=<root dir of gcc that also contain gcj>

--with-java-prefix=<root dir of JDK that you wish to use>
Only required if the build process does not find your java compiler. If you
have more than one JDK then type "which java" to find out which is the default.


BUILD AND INSTALL:

Run ./make or ./make all
Run ./make install

You can save space after the build by running ./make clean. If you later want
to uninstall then run ./make uninstall.




Have fun
